A broadcast is a way of sending a message from a sprite which can be heard by all sprites. Think of it like an announcement made over a loudspeaker.

### Send a broadcast

You can send a broadcast by creating a broadcast block and giving it a name:

+ Find the **broadcast** block under **Events**

+ Select **New Message** in the drop-down menu.

+ Then type your message

The message text can be anything you like, but it is useful to give the broadcast a sensible description. What happens when the message is received depends on the code you write.

### Receive a broadcast

A sprite can react to a broadcast by using this block:

![Receive a broadcast](images/receive-a-broadcast.png)

You can add blocks below this block to tell the sprite what to do when it receives the broadcast signal.
